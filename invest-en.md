# Investments in VIZ

*The following is the position of the VIZPLUS Initiative, other VIZ participants may have different views on VIZ (or the same). None of the statements on this page constitute investment advice. Only you make decisions related to your assets.*

**Important warning**!

You do not need viz tokens if you do not understand what and for whom they are intended, what ideas are behind them, and what can be done with them. If you treat VIZ as “another crypto that will pamp against the background of general growth”, you will surely be disappointed. Don't invest in VIZ, buy some shitcoin and wait to the Moon. Please pass by. Thanks.

## Why invest in a VIZ

### The third activity is social activity

In the modern world, a person works to rest and rests to work. He works, receives a salary, spends it (as well as time and knowledge) on food, housing, clothing, a car, a useful seminar and a trip to Turkey to be healthy enough, strong and knowledgeable, and work better, getting more money for a little more delicious food, nice clothes, an expensive car, a university for children and a trip to the Maldives.

Simply, a person receives resources from other people to spend them on himself, to receive more resources from others, etc. — up to death or retirement.

Both of these areas of life - work and recreation — are served by the traditional economy, the key element of which is the voluntary equivalent exchange of the results of labor through the mediation of money.

In recent years the third part of human life has been actively developing - social activity in large and diverse groups. These are publications on on social networking services, participation in “neighborhood”, civic and political activities, online games, activity in communities with brands, amateur sports, interactive entertainment with voting for other participants, and much more.

This activity requires a person to use the resources available to him (money, time, knowledge) — as well as rest. And at the same time, it benefits other people or makes them happy — as well as work. But the exchange of the results of such activities is not associated with money and does not seek to be equivalent, as in the traditional economy. 

> Example  
> Someone posts funny cats on Instagram not because they are paying for it or because they are recuperating for the next working day (otherwise they would have “posted” them to their disk), but because the Instagram user gives pleasure (or even benefit) to other people and receives a positive reaction from them — likes and thankfulness.

In turn, other people post memes about politicians on Twitter, bringing benefit and pleasure to the lover of cats and politicians, for which they are thankfulness.

There is no equivalent exchange here: he doesn't have to post three cats to look at one meme with Trump. There is no exchange on Instagram or Twitter that sets the exchange rate of likes received for cats for the right to watch memes with Trump.

In addition, the  received likes, unlike the money earned by hard work in the office, cannot be put off for the future in order to exchange for useful advice from a specialist on a forum on a financial website.

It turns out that in the third — social — activity, the traditional economy does not work: the exchange of benefits is not equivalent, it is impossible to save the received gratitude for the future, as well as to transfer it from one resource to another. As long as such activities remained a small part of the "relaxation", such a state of affairs could be tolerated. Now, when social activity takes up a significant part of the lives of hundreds of millions of people, it is time to take action.

### Vizonomics — economics of social activity

VIZ is able to serve social activity: it provides a universal tool for expressing and receiving non-financial thankfulness, preserves the received thankfulness in the form of a person's social capital and makes the use of accumulated social capital simple, intuitive and effective — both online and offline ...

VIZ is not a part of the economy, it is a whole economy — the economy of something that cannot be estimated with money, the economy of the whole world of social relations and interactions. Let's mention some of the elements of this world.

**Social networking services**. Social networks, messengers with public groups and channels, blog services, video hosting sites with user ratings, forums. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Telegram, VK, Medium.

**Superappas**. A large company creates or combines many services that cover completely different customer needs, around one user login. In superapps, you can often rate or like services and work performers, as well as other users. WeChat, Yandex, Sberbank.

**TV**. Television offers more and more interactive programs in which viewers can at least choose the best participant in a show or competition in their opinion, as a maximum - take part in the development of the plot. "Dancing with the Stars" (audience ratings), Formula 1 (choosing the best driver in the race), Eurovision Song Contest.

**Rating of the system of services and goods**. The evaluation of goods and services by buyers is available in almost every online store. There are many services that specialize in collecting and analyzing such estimates. Amazon, IMDB, Yandex Market, Booking.com.

As well as business loyalty programs, dating services, mutual technical support services, answering services, wiki-like resources and, finally, direct thankfulness of people to each other.

Any interaction between people in which there is a "like", rating, thankfulness or vote can be improved with the VIZ and can be serviced by the VIZ. This is the economy of the Third Activity, the economy of social activity, or simply vizonomics.

### Blockchain VIZ — a decentralized network of vizonomics

As well as Bitcoin blockchain stores and transfers financial value, i.e. financial capital, the VIZ blockchain stores and transfers social value belonging to a person, i.e. its social capital.

> **More about the structure of the VIZ blockchain**

> The VIZ blockchain is designed so that only its owner or the one to whom he transferred the right of such access (account keys) has access to the use of social capital. At the same time, there are three levels of access: from practically not causing problems in case of compromise to complete, which makes the use of the blockchain safer and more convenient.

> The consensus algorithm [Fair DPoS](https://control.viz.world/media/@on1x/fair-dpos/) in the VIZ blockchain excludes the success of the 51% attack. To censor or forge transactions, attackers need to become delegates and get votes from the owners of about 90% of social capital, while effectively dividing them among “their” delegates who sign blocks. In practice, such a concentration of votes is impossible. Therefore, no force is able to censor user transactions, allow or forbid them to do anything that the code allows to do. 

> The finality of a transaction on the VIZ blockchain occurs about a minute after its completion, but in reality, applications usually only need one confirmation of the transaction by a top delegate, which takes no more than 6 seconds.

> The total amount of transmitted data depends more on the technical parameters of the nodes (servers) of the blockchain than on its code, while the size of an individual transaction is usually several tens of bytes, therefore, thousands of ordinary transactions can be written to each block (every 3 seconds).

> There are no smart contracts in the VIZ blockchain, all the logic of interactions with accounts is moved to the application level. They can both broadcast transactions directly to the blockchain and "imitate" transactions, periodically writing an updated state to the blockchain, which saves blockchain resources.

The VIZ blockchain is simple, flexible, fast, allowing a huge number of transactions and protected from attacks. The social capital accumulated by the user is securely stored and easily used. Decentralization allows you not to worry about the possibility of censoring awards, and bringing the logic to the application layer simplifies their development.

In vizonomics, the blockchain acts as an immutable and incorruptible "memory" of all participants and a tool for using the data accumulated in this "memory".

In addition, as in the real world, the former merits of the VIZ participants lose value over time: the constant small emission of new tokens (10% per year) gradually reduces the influence of the old social capital on the distribution of awards.

### Social capital is a non-financial instrument of influence

A person with large social capital (who has accumulated thankfulness and a good attitude from others) has advantages over “no-name”. Other people are more willing to provide him with services, do something useful or pleasant, without requiring direct payment. This is due to the higher value of the thankfulness of such a person.

> Example  
> It is enough for a popular blogger to hint that he would not mind a free tour in an unfamiliar city, and he will receive at least a few offers. A successful athlete uses his status (social capital) to advance political or civic views. An active participant in the Telegram chat, who helped many newbies to deal with a complex program, is more likely to receive an answer to a question not related to the chat topic than an unknown user who can simply be banned for offtopic.

Digital social capital in the VIZ makes the status of a person (more correctly, an account) visible and transferable from one community to another. Large social capital in a VIZ means that its owner has brought a lot of benefit to other people — directly by their actions or by purchasing vizes, which has added value to someone else's social capital.

The dependence of the size of awards on the size of social capital allows differentiating the influence of VIZ participants on others. People are more willing to bring benefit or pleasure to the owner of large social capital, since he can award more in thankfulness for this benefit.

Despite the fact that vizes can be bought and sold, the exchange of benefits and awards itself is not financial in nature, since the size of the award is a matter of goodwill of the awarding person, and not a pre-agreed amount of vizes. The interactions of VIZ participants in the “benefit-award-benefit” cycle occur outside the traditional economy and are not transactions.

Digital social capital can belong not only to a person, but also to an organization, a group of people, or a bot. Accordingly, the influence of social capital can be divided into several directions:

> **p2p** — a person with the help of awards influences other people, stimulating them to bring him non-financial benefits;

> **p2b** — a person influences or expresses an opinion about business, political organization, public initiative, etc.;

> **b2p** — the organization increases the social capital of people who benefit it (business awards customers), or stimulates them to act in a certain way (a political party awards supporters).
 
### Social interaction protocols — a common language for applications

The logic and context of interaction between VIZ participants are moved to the application level, that is, there are no smart contracts in VIZ that are executed directly in the blockchain. However, there is an "intermediate" solution using the properties of both private applications and the "general" blockchain: protocols.

In the VIZ blockchain, you can save not only strictly defined data (awards, token transfers, etc.), but also free text records. Such records can be structured by the creator of the application. If the creators of other applications agree to save some data with a given structure and read it for their own purposes, then such a structure becomes a general protocol for records of a certain type.

> Example  
> Let's say someone has developed a protocol describing the profile of a VIZ participant: 
>
> name:”...”; about:”...”; date_of_birth:”...”; gender:”...”; nationality:”...”; telegram:”...”; fb:”...”
>
> Then any application can save the data of its users in the blockchain in this format and read the data of both its own and any other users, showing them in a convenient form. 

Protocols can be very complex and contain a data structure for any application: social networks, messengers, user issued assets, and completely exotic solutions. 

> Example 
> The VIZ describes the [Whisper protocol](https://control.viz.world/media/@on1x/ru-viz-whisper-protocol/) for the exchange of messages between users, in which an external observer cannot determine either the sender or the addressee nor the content of the message, even though it is on the public blockchain.

In other words, the protocols in the VIZ are standards for the exchange of information through the blockchain voluntarily adopted by application developers. Applications running on the same protocol have a common user base, but compete, offering users their own unique features: user-friendly design, additional filtering and data processing (or its fundamental absence), data analysis, etc.

> Example  
> Some applications running on the social network protocol can block some accounts for their users (spam, pornography or kremlebots), while others, on the contrary, show only accounts allowed by a special algorithm, while third one do not block anything, declaring freedom of speech. At the same time, a single "database" of messages for all applications will be located in the blockchain.

Similar protocols created by different developers can complement each other or compete with each other, evolving the VIZ ecosystem.

One of the first ready-made and actively developing protocols in VIZ is a distributed social network protocol without censorship. It provides the ability to publish and receive information without any control from anyone other than the user himself. Among other things, there is a serverless social network client [Readdle.Me](https://readdle.me/) that works directly in the user's browser and communicates directly with the blockchain without the mediation of any server.

### Decentralized management — protection against bad decisions

VIZ does not and cannot have an owner, “main shareholder”, director or “boss” in any sense. But there is no anarchy either. The governance system is well balanced: it has a group of selected (literally) participants who make decisions, but the composition of these participants (they are called “delegates”) partially rotates every minute and can change rapidly if their actions do not suit the owners of social capital.

To make key decisions related to changing the blockchain code, the consent of at least 17 delegates is required, of which at least 7 must be among the selected top 11. At the same time, the likelihood of participation in the vote for changing the code for delegates not from the top 11 directly depends on their position in the list of delegates, that is, they should also have significant support from the owners of social capital. In other words, attackers who want to change the blockchain code against the will of ordinary VIZ participants must guarantee themselves a minimum of 7 places in the top and 10 places as close to the top as possible (or better, much more). To do this, they will need the support of about 90% of the social capital in the system, which seems extremely unlikely.

On the other hand, VIZ has an unusually flexible and voluminous system of technical and economic settings for the blockchain. To regulate the current activities of the blockchain, consensus is not required: the settings are set based on the median value of the parameters set by the delegates. Accordingly, delegates can quickly respond to the needs of the community by adjusting the blockchain parameters to the current situation.

The control system in VIZ is built taking into account the mistakes made by the creators of other blockchains, where decisions are made in a similar way. In the Visa, the largest participants can influence decisions by supporting those delegates with their social capital who are ready to fulfill their wishes. But even the combined strength of several of the largest participants will not be enough to "capture" the blockchain. And if they manage to collect more than 90% of social capital in support of their decision, then this is no longer a "capture", but legitimate support.

## Token viz

### Not money

Viz tokens are not cryptocurrencies, not coins, not instrument of payment. Of course, like any crypto asset and any standard thing in the real world, vizes can be exchanged for something else, using them as a measure of value. In the same way you can use cigarettes, canned food, cast iron blanks, postage stamps and bottles of vodka. But useability does not make all of these assets money in a general sense.

Viz tokens are needed for certain purposes in certain situations, and their theoretically possible function of a payment intermediary in transactions is not the main one.

### Not securities

Viz tokens are not stocks, bonds, futures, options, or even CDS. Simply put, not securities. Viz tokens are not issued by any organization, do not represent a share in a business or someone else's obligation, do not reflect the value of any other asset, do not promise profit.

The initial distribution of viz tokens was free of charge, by the free will of an unknown person and was not associated with any obligations. All further monetary transactions with tokens were not and will not be an emission, the parties to such transactions only resell an existing digital asset to each other, based on their intentions to use this asset.

### Not "tickets" of the financial pyramid

In the VIZ economy, there is no fundraising for investment in foreign assets and there is no income from such assets, so no one can promise any "payments", "dividends", "interest", etc. to token holders.

The VIZ does not have a “central authority” that buys and sells tokens, setting their price. The price of a token, expressed in money or cryptocurrency, is determined exclusively in the course of private transactions of equal participants.

Tokens have a specific purpose — they service non-financial transactions between ecosystem participants.

### What is viz token?

Despite the fact that the VIZ ecosystem and vizonomics are outside the ordinary economy and ordinary finance, it needs a tool to take into account the main value - digital social capital. Such a tool is viz tokens circulating in the VIZ blockchain.

The main function of viz tokens is to serve as a unit of measurement of the digital social capital of VIZ participants.

A person's height is measured in centimeters, weight — in kilograms, financial capital - with one or other money, achievements in chess - with ELO rating points, and social capital - with vizes. The token itself is not "secured", does not reflect the value of any other asset, and is not a financial instrument.

Vizes can be in one of two forms: low liquid (in social capital) and fully liquid (“in the wallet” or “on the account”). The withdrawal of 100% of vizes from social capital to a liquid state occurs in 28 iterations, each one once a day (delegates can change this value). Fewer vizes are withdrawal proportionally faster. The reverse transfer - from a liquid state to social capital occurs instantly.

### Tokens and money

On the whole, vizonomics is self-sufficient: vizes serve the distribution and circulation of social capital, which is a value in itself and does not require external evaluation in terms of money. There is no central operator obligated to sell or buy vizes at any price, but liquid tokens are freely exchanged for cryptocurrencies or money through private transactions.

The ability to buy vizes (and ultimately increase social capital for money) allows VIZ participants to quickly increase their non-financial influence and more stimulate others to be useful. In turn, the sale of surplus vizes helps participants finance the costs of maintaining the blockchain and applications and earn from social activities.

In addition, until the intrinsic value of social capital has become apparent to everyone, the market price of vizes makes the value of awards more understandable. This encourages VIZ participants to maintain their capital at a level at which the awards they give out are sufficiently "weighty" for the recipients.

> Example  
> The VIZ participant has social capital that allows him to make 20 awards per day with an average of 1.5 viz for each award. At the market price of a viz of 1 cent, the reward is perceived as “sufficient”. But with a price of 0.2 cents, the participant should think about increasing capital or reducing the number of awards, so that each award is more "weighty" for the recipient. Conversely, if a viz costs 10 cents, you can sell some of the capital or increase the number of rewards, since 15 cents per like may seem like an excessive award.

With the development of VIZs, the focus on the “monetary” value of awards will cease to play a significant role: social capital will become a self-sufficient value, and the attitude towards the size of awards will be based on the ratio between the size of the award and the average size of a person's social capital.

### The turnover of liquid viz

Despite the fact that VIZ is focused on the concept of digital social capital, it has the ability to use fully liquid tokens for various operations. Let's list the available options.

**Transferring social capital between accounts** - the main function of viz liquid tokens. In VIZ, it is impossible to transfer social capital directly from one account to another. To do this, it must be withdrawn into liquid tokens, sent to another account and there again to be capitalized. If desired, a certain number of tokens can be left and stored in the "wallet", but in this form they do not benefit the owner, since they are not taken into account when awards.

Also, liquid viz's are required to **pay commissions** for some rare actions in the blockchain: creating an application to the DAO Fund, setting an account for sale, declaring an account as a delegate, etc. This is done to protect the blockchain from spam with applications. The size of the commissions is determined by the delegates.

In liquid tokens **funds are paid from the DAO Fund**.

VIZ has a unique feature **recurrent (automatically recurring) payments** with liquid tokens directly through the blockchain. Its obvious application is paying for any kind of subscription — for content, goods, services, charitable payments, etc.

**Checks** are used to transfer liquid tokens outside the network. The user "writes a check", blocking a certain number of tokens and associating them with a public / private key pair, and transfers the check (keys) to another user in any way outside the blockchain (in person, by email, via a messenger, etc.). The recipient can “cash” the check into his account at any time.

Finally, vizes are used **as a cryptocurrency** — to instantly pay for goods and services without commission by a simple transfer. This is not the main function, but if someone is ready to accept vizes in payment for something, and someone is willing to pay with them, then the VIZ blockchain allows you to do this.

## Emission in VIZ

### Base emission

The emission rates of viz tokens are set in the blockchain code and can only be changed by a consensus decision of delegates. Initially and until now, the annual emission is 10% of the total number of viz as of the last September 29th. During the year, tokens are emitted in equal portions in each block.

The initial number of tokens was 50 million, respectively, 5 million new tokens were emitted in the first year, 5.5 million in the second, etc.

The emitted tokens in each block are automatically distributed in three directions: payment for the signing of the block by the delegate, awards and the DAO Fund. Distribution shares are determined by delegates, but, unlike the emission rate, changes in shares do not require consensus, they are calculated according to the median of values published by delegates.

### Frozen tokens

At the end of December 2019, VIZ participants on1x and ae decided to freeze a significant part of their assets (28 million and 4 million viz, respectively), followed by a gradual unfreezing over seven years. Frozen tokens cannot be received ahead of schedule without a consensus decision of the delegates, which seems extremely unlikely.

Accordingly, since January 2020, there are much fewer tokens in real turnover in vizonomics than were originally emitted. At the same time, the rates of the main emission remained the same, and the gradual unfreezing of tokens can be considered an "additional" emission. As a result, if we talk about the real rates of token circulation, they are higher than the formal ones: from 28% in 2020 to 18% in 2026. Starting in 2027, the rates of formal and real emission will equalize, as all previously frozen tokens will be unfrozen.

![Number of viz in circulation by years](https://github.com/vizplus/viz-invest/blob/main/vizsupply.png)

### Influence of delegates on emissions

Delegates can influence the emission of viz tokens in two ways.

First, in theory, they can update the blockchain code to change the size of the emission itself. This action requires a consensus decision, that is, even with a small "opposition" it will be blocked.

Secondly, delegates can change the parameters of the distribution of emissions by directions, which is much easier and does not require intervention in the code. Such a change can have significant consequences for the entire vizonomics, since the size of awards, that is, the efficiency of using social capital, depends on the distribution of emissions. And an increase or decrease in contributions to the DAO Fund will change the attractiveness of work in the interests of the entire VIZ ecosystem.

## Distribution of social capital in VIZ

### First phase: testing (2018-2020)

The first 50 million viz tokens were distributed by an anonymous author who launched the VIZ blockchain at the end of September 2018. The distribution was based on data on donations made by several people to create the blockchain code, as well as information on the amount of work of the author of the code. The primary distribution of tokens according to this scheme is a voluntary choice of an unknown person, he did not have an obligation to follow any pre-set or rules. In total, 21 accounts received tokens during the initial distribution.

![Initial distribution of viz](https://github.com/vizplus/viz-invest/blob/main/firstviz.png)

Over the next two years, the mission and concept of the project were clarified, applications were created, and blockchain capabilities were tested. At this time, there was no advertising campaign, users came themselves, realizing that they were receiving the service “as is,” in fact, on the basis of beta testing.

During this time, more than 12 million viz were emitted and distributed. Of these, 2.4 million viz were received by delegates supporting the operation of the blockchain, 4.3 million viz went through the DAO Foundation and about 5 million viz went to the recipients of the awards (the rest is the current balance of the DAO Fund and the current Award Fund).

Several million viz changed owners in the course of trading on the exchange, exchanges through various exchangers and direct deals.

At the end of December 2019, VIZ participants on1x (aka in) and ae froze a total of 32 million viz with gradual defrosting over 7 years. This was done in order to improve the situation with the decentralization of the ecosystem and to remove concerns about the possibility of quickly selling a large number of tokens. In 2020, 1.2 million viz were unfrozen. 

At the end of 2020, on1x and ae controlled a total of about 13 million viz out of about 31 million viz in the economy (42% versus 85% at the start). Among other large owners of social capital and liquid tokens at the same time: speculator — 2.9 million viz; smailer — 1.8 million viz; denis-skripnik — 1.4 million viz; litrbooh — 1.4 million viz; id and kelechek — more than 1 million viz (all data are approximate and based on VIZPLUS estimates, since VIZ accounts are anonymous).

In total, by the end of 2020, about 3800 accounts owned viz tokens, but the vast majority of them are technical or created during spam attacks. Nevertheless, there were about 250 accounts in the ecosystem with significant social capital (from 1,000 viz).

### Second phase: start of growth (2021-2023)

The beginning of the second phase of the VIZ's existence can be considered the full-fledged opening in January 2021 of the viz.plus website with information and promo materials, as well as the necessary services.

The site should become the "entry point" to the VIZ for everyone interested: users, developers, entrepreneurs, investors. It is to the site that the flow of visitors will be attracted through advertising and PR, and chats in the Telegram messenger are selected for technical support of users and consulting developers, entrepreneurs and investors.

According to the forecasts of the VIZPLUS Initiative, the following areas will be developed in 2021-2023:

- connecting small and medium sites and applications to VIZ;
- massive expansion of VIZ in Telegram;
- creation of the financial part of the ecosystem - services for buying and selling vizes and renting social capital;
- the emergence of new active investors participating in the development of VIZ;
- the appearance of the first "corporate" VIZ participants with relatively large social capital for loyalty programs and rewarding clients;
- using the capabilities of the VIZ blockchain that are not related to social capital (distributed social services, shops accepting liquid vizes, etc.);
- expansion of VIZ to English-speaking markets.

By the end of 2023, about 60 million viz will be in circulation, i.e. the supply of tokens (supply) will double compared to the end of 2020. However, the development of the ecosystem (the emergence of businesses and new investors) and an increase in the number of active participants by at least three orders of magnitude will not only absorb this growth, but also create a significant shortage of tokens, which will lead to growth their prices, also calculated in orders.

![Expected distribution of viz at the end of 2023](https://github.com/vizplus/viz-invest/blob/main/2023.png)

### The third phase: the formation of a mature ecosystem (2024-2030)

In the third phase of development, VIZ should become a familiar addition to almost any online and offline social activity in developed countries. A person's digital social capital will eventually become one of his usual attributes — like an account in a particular social service, a phone number, or a list of hobbies.

Probably, in a few years, the bulk of the awards will be distributed by large holders of social capital - companies, organizations or informal groups of participants, which in this way will retain the loyalty of users, followers or fans. Also, the use of incentives in the form of VIZ awards and in the education/upbringing system in addition to grades cannot be ruled out — and this can become a huge segment of vizonomics. Nevertheless, in ordinary social relationships of people, rewards for benefit or pleasure will become a sign of "good form". 

It is expected that services for renting social capital will be developed for corporate and private users. Such services will delegate social capital for a time to users who do not have the ability or desire to buy or acquire it. Corporate clients can use the leased capital in one-off marketing campaigns, while private clients can use it to increase their influence in the communities or increase their self-esteem.

![Expected distribution of viz at the end of 2030](https://github.com/vizplus/viz-invest/blob/main/2030.png)

With an increase in activity by several orders of magnitude, it will be necessary to modernize the VIZ blockchain so that it can withstand the corresponding load and be more user-friendly.

In terms of convenience, for example, at some point delegates will have to consider splitting tokens. By the end of 2029, the offer of vizes will reach 145 million. If we assume that about a third of them will belong to individual users, whose number reaches 100 million people (1/10 of the Facebook audience), then one user will have a capital of about 0.5 viz. and the size of the usual reward (with 1% energy) will be less than 0.0001 viz. Obviously, it makes sense to periodically split tokens 10 or 100 times.

## Model for assessing the value of viz

Unlike cryptocurrencies and most other crypto assets, the viz token has a certain fundamentally justified value, which can be translated into an estimated price. This price is not someone's obligation, it is based on several assumptions, and the market may at the moment evaluate viz in a completely different way. Nevertheless, it is of some interest.

One of the basic concepts in the VIZ is a award, that is, a one-time increase in the digital social capital of one participant by another. The size of the award is measured in vizes and formally has no financial value: an increase in social capital is valuable in itself, since it increases a person's influence (more precisely, an account) on other participants in the VIZ. Nevertheless, until the VIZ is widespread, people will, out of habit, at least to some extent be guided by the “value” of the award, expressed in money.

It is reasonable to assume that over time, the VIZ ecosystem will develop an opinion about the acceptable size of the “in-the-money” reward. There are hardly many people who want to routinely like posts in microblogs for a dollar at a time. On the other hand, liking $ 0.0005 is not very interesting either.

It seems to us that an ordinary VIZ participant can, without regrets and without fear, be known as greedy to reward approximately $ 0.1-0.5 per day ($ 40-200 per year), giving out 10-20-50 "usual" awards. Accordingly, the generally accepted size of the award will be approximately 1-5 cents. Taking into account the current and expected reward of social capital at 20-25% per annum, the monetary value of the average capital of an active participant should be about $ 500 (in a wide range from $ 200 to $ 1000).

The second parameter that needs to be calculated for this model is the average number of tokens in the capital of an active participant. To do this, from the total number of tokens in circulation, one should subtract liquid tokens, the shares of large investors, corporations and rental services, as well as the "dead" capital that actually went out of circulation. The remainder is divided by the number of active members.

The result is a simple ratio of the monetary value of "ordinary" social capital and its size in vizes, which gives an idea of the estimated price of the token.

> If the above model of token distribution at the end of the second phase of VIZ development turns out to be correct, then active users will have about 25-30% of 60 million viz in social capital, that is, 15-18 million viz. Accordingly, with 100 thousand active VIZ users, the average participant's capital will be 150-180 viz. This gives an estimated viz price of $ 3.

Of course, such a calculation is very approximate and says more about the order of magnitude than about a specific value. That is, when these parameters are reached, it is rational to expect a viz price in units of dollars by the end of 2023, but tens of dollars or the first of cents seem unlikely.

## How to invest in VIZ

The best option for investing in VIZ is buying tokens from developers and entrepreneurs involved in the development of the ecosystem.

Typically, developers receive token payments from the DAO Fund for work useful to the community and sell a portion of these tokens to investors. This way of buying is doubly useful: it not only allows you to value vizes, but also brings additional value to the ecosystem. In addition, this way you can buy a fairly large number of vizes at once at a relatively low price.

Also in Telegram there is a group [VIZ+Trade](https://t.me/vizplus_trade), where you can negotiate a deal with other VIZ participants.

Exchange trades in viz are held on the decentralized exchange on Graphene blockchain: [RUDEX](https://market.rudex.org/#/market/XCHNG.VIZ_XCHNG.USDT) as an asset XCHNG.VIZ mainly paired with XCHNG.USDT. To buy vizes on the exchange, you need to create an account on it (no identification is required), enter the required currency through the XCHNG gateway (preferably USDT), buy XCHNG.VIZ and withdraw them through the XCHNG gateway to your VIZ account. This option is recommended for those who are well versed in trading on the decentralized exchange.

You can also buy vizes for cash or cryptocurrency at the [viz check store](https://viz.media/shop). This option implies low liquidity and high price, but is simple and fast.

Finally, large amounts of viz for cryptocurrency can be purchased from the [Menaskop shop](https://menaskop.xyz/).
